Hi! I am Peisong Wang, currently a second-year graduate student at Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI) of Tsinghua University, advised by Professor Wai Kin (Victor) Chan.

I am an intern at the Information Thrust of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), adviced by Professor [Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia). 

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Engineering in 2022 from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

I graduated from Shenzhen Foreign Language School in 2018.

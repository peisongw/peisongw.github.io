Hi! I am Peisong Wang (ÁéãÊ≤õÊùæ in Chinese), currently a last-year master's student at Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Wai Kin (Victor) Chan](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/cwj_en/main.htm).

I am an intern at the Information Thrust of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, adviced by Professor [Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia). 

I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Engineering in 2022 from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

I graduated from Shenzhen Foreign Language School in 2018.

Research Interest
======
* Large Language Model, Data Mining.

News
======
2025.5 Can today's LLMs truly understand you, not just your words? ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏è
Introducing [Sentient Agent as a Judge: Evaluating Higher-Order Social Cognition in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02847) ‚Äî the first evaluation framework that uses sentient agents to simulate human emotional dynamics and inner reasoning for assessing social cognition in LLM conversations. 

2025.4 We introduce a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation in thepaper [SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19162).

2025.2 We release our reseach on the reasoning ability of LLMs [S¬≤R: Teaching LLMs to Self-verify and Self-correct via Reinforcement Learning](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.12853).

2024.9 Our paper [GLBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07457) accepted by NeurIPS'24 Datasets and Benchmarks Track!

2024.7 I start my internship in Tencent and conduct researches on LLMs.

2024.6 Our research paper [Data-driven Uncertainty Revenue Modeling for Computation Resource Allocation in Recommendation Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3712729.3712782) accepted by WSC'24 (Top conference in Simulation)!

2024.5 Our research paper [ZeroG: Investigating Cross-dataset Zero-shot Transferability in Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11235) accepted by KDD'24!

2024.4 Our survey [A Survey of Graph Meets Large Language Model: Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12399) accepted by IJCAI'24!

2023.11 We publish a survey paper: [A Survey of Graph Meets Large Language Model: Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12399) and the corresponding github repo: [Awesome-LLMs-in-Graph-tasks](https://github.com/yhLeeee/Awesome-LLMs-in-Graph-tasks).

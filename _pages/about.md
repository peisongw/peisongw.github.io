Hi! I am Peisong Wang (王沛松 in Chinese), currently a first-year Ph.D student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), advised by Professor [Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia). 

I received my Master's degree in Data Science and Information Technology in 2025 from Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Wai Kin (Victor) Chan](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/cwj_en/main.htm).

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Information Engineering in 2022 from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

I graduated from Shenzhen Foreign Language School in 2018.

Research Interest
======
* LLM Reasoning and Agents.

News
======
2026.1 Our paper [RLVER: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Emotion Rewards for Empathetic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03112) is accepted by ICLR'26!

2025.9 I start my doctoral program in HKUST (GZ).

2025.8 I have completed my one-year internship at Tencent! I mainly focus on research into LLMs’ reasoning capabilities during the internship. Here are [Papers and Technical Reports I contributed to during my internship](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peisong-wang-67b7292b4_llm-reasoning-degitalhuman-activity-7359573042290749442-x8ay?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEuR9n8B9FYCPpLvr40XcSNN-0b8idvBPCg).
 

2025.4 We introduce a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation in the paper [SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19162). (Update: Accepted by NeurIPS'25!)

2025.2 We release our reseach on the reasoning ability of LLMs [S²R: Teaching LLMs to Self-verify and Self-correct via Reinforcement Learning](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.12853). (Update: Accepted by ACL'25!)

2024.9 Our paper [GLBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07457) is accepted by NeurIPS'24 Datasets and Benchmarks Track!

2024.7 I start my internship in Tencent and conduct researches on LLMs.

2024.6 Our research paper [Data-driven Uncertainty Revenue Modeling for Computation Resource Allocation in Recommendation Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3712729.3712782) accepted by WSC'24 (Top conference in Simulation)!

2024.5 Our research paper [ZeroG: Investigating Cross-dataset Zero-shot Transferability in Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11235) is accepted by KDD'24!

2024.4 Our survey [A Survey of Graph Meets Large Language Model: Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12399) is accepted by IJCAI'24!

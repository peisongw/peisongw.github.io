Hi! I am Peisong Wang, currently a second-year graduate student at Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Wai Kin (Victor) Chan](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/cwj/main.htm).

I am an intern at the Information Thrust of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, adviced by Professor [Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia). 

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Engineering in 2022 from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

I graduated from Shenzhen Foreign Language School in 2018.
